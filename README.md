# AcreLog

This user command puts acre's log file onto a GUI. 

If you don't use acre there is no point in having this user command.

acre uses an ordinary editor window in order to put its log on display. That can be annoying for a number of reasons. ]AcreLog gets you around this by displaying the log in a GUI instead.

]AcreLog uses HTML renderer and therefore requires at least version 17.0 of Dyalog APL.
