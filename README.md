# AcreLog

This user command puts acre's log file onto a GUI. 

If you don't use [acre](https://github.com/the-carlisle-group/Acre-Desktop "acre on GitHub") there is no point in having this user command.

acre uses an ordinary editor window in order to put its log on display. That can be annoying for a number of reasons. `]AcreLog` gets you around this by displaying the log in a GUI instead.

`]AcreLog` uses HTMLRenderer and therefore requires at least version 17.0 of Dyalog APL.
